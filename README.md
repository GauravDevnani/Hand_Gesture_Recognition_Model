# 🌟Hand Gesture Recognition Model🌟

🎯Introduction

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow and Keras to accurately identify and classify different hand gestures from image or video data. The model is trained on the Kaggle dataset to learn and distinguish between various hand gestures.

🎯Features

✔️Data preprocessing and augmentation: The dataset is prepared for training by applying necessary transformations like resizing, normalization, and augmentation to improve model performance.

✔️Convolutional Neural Network (CNN): A CNN architecture is designed and implemented using TensorFlow and Keras to extract relevant features from the input images.

✔️Model training and evaluation: The CNN model is trained on the labeled dataset and evaluated on a separate validation set to assess its accuracy and generalization capabilities.

✔️Support for custom datasets: The model can be adapted to work with custom datasets by modifying the data loading and preprocessing steps.

✔️Visualization of results: Visualizations are provided to help understand the model's performance and identify areas for improvement.

🎯Data Description

The dataset used for this project is sourced from the Kaggle dataset LeapGestRecog. It contains images of different hand gestures captured using the Leap Motion sensor.

🎯Sample Data

The dataset consists of several main folders, each corresponding to a different gesture. Each folder contains numerous images of that particular gesture.

🎯Data Source

The data used in this project is sourced from the Kaggle dataset LeapGestRecog. Ensure your dataset is in a similar format for compatibility.
